# Bikesharing ðŸš²

## 1. Overview 

Citi Bike is a bike-sharing company in New York with its data released to the public. Our stakeholders would like to replicate its success in Des Moines. Based on the data we have access to, we can determine: 

1. The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
2. The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
3. The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## 2. Results 

The results of this analysis have been published on **tableau public** and can be accessed using [this link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/allen5835/viz/Challenge14-NYCBikeriderdata/Challenge14-CityBike)

### 2.1. Rider distribution

This worksheet shows the spread of users across New York. The interactive map details the count of users based on their location. It also indicates the final destination of the user. Based on the size of the circles, it is evident that the spread is thining radially with Union square as the center.

## 3. Summary

The success in New York can be replicated based on this analysis. Gender, time and day of the week play a important role in making this business venture viable. 

Two additional analyses (2.1 and 2.6) were conducted to help plan repairs and identify the location of repair stations. To deepen the uderstanding of the data, we could also arrive at the follwing two worksheets:

* Trip duration based on the day and gender
* Trip duration based on the age and gender
